== Description ==

Enrich your website with styled, consistent, vector, scalable, pixel-perfect, first-class, shiny-ass icons. Insert icons in the post for less than 8 seconds.
Keep your site cool. Save your time. Work with pleasure.


Hi! We are [Icons8](https://icons8.com/about/?utm_campaign=enricher_wordpress&utm_source=wordpress&utm_refcode=I9AE) team. We draw icons. [Daily](https://icons8.com/web-app/new-icons/all?utm_campaign=enricher_wordpress&utm_source=wordpress&utm_refcode=I9AE). For free. [By users requests](https://icons8.com/request-icon/?utm_campaign=enricher_wordpress&utm_source=wordpress&utm_refcode=I9AE). We have drawn more than 43 000 icons in 10 consistent styles.
We also create various useful things for the community.

The WordPress Icons Enricher plugin allows to insert vector icons in your blog posts and pages. Decorate your menu with icons.

There are seven icon packs included now:

* LineAwesome
* FontAwesome
* Ionicons
* Simple Line Icons
* Weather Icons
* Typicons
* Foundation Icons

They are 3067 icons altogether.

The WordPress Icons Enricher plugin is optimized for traffic: even if there are several icon packs in the plugin, it will attach to page only required resources such as CSS, JS, web-fonts etc. For some icon packs you may enable the [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) usage - it will reduce traffic from your host and decrease page loading time. Site visitors value it.

You will choose the icons using the nice and fast UI with associative search:

* You don't have to choose one icon from limitless comboboxes
* You don't have to look up the sheets of tiny pictures when searching for the damn "thumb up"
* You don't have to remember the exact icon names so you may search the icons by context, not by names 

Enter "like", "good", "perfect", "finger", "thumb", "approve", "hand" or "facebook" and get you favorite icon.
